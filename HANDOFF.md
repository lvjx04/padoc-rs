# PADOC — Paper Experiment Handoff

This document is the single point of truth for the next agent working on the
PADOC paper. It captures (1) the original experimental plan that the human
PI signed off on, (2) the current status of every item in that plan,
(3) the *why* behind PADOC's analysis speed-up so the next agent can write
about it without re-deriving the argument, and (4) the concrete remaining
work, ordered by impact and effort.

The supporting numbers are in `EXPERIMENTS.md` (paper-style tables) and the
raw TSVs / inspect dumps under `results/main/`. Drivers are in `scripts/`.

Repo HEAD at the time of writing: commit `121d290` on
[`lvjx04/padoc-rs`](https://github.com/lvjx04/padoc-rs).

## 3. Why PADOC analyses are faster — the principle

The next agent should be able to read this section and write the *why*
paragraph of the paper without re-running anything. Three ideas, in
order of how often they fire.

### 3.1 Templates instead of events

A baseline (raw / gzip / ScalaTrace / TraceZip) decompresses to a
`Trace` whose central object is `Vec<Event>` — one entry per recorded
event. Every analysis must therefore touch every event:
`O(events)` work, where `events` is 3.5 M for `leworldmodel_full`,
33.8 M for `qwen3_full`, 80.2 M for `unifolm_full`, 301 M for
`llama_full`.

PADOC's `CompressedTrace` keeps a `Vec<Template>` (one entry per
distinct event class) plus a per-rank `Node` tree that points at
templates. Every per-instance numeric / argument / digit value lives
in a column inside the template, not as a standalone event. So an
analysis that wants to *summarise* events touches templates instead:
`O(templates)`, where `templates` is 4 K – 17 K on the small datasets
and **312 on llama**. The structural ratio events / templates is
965 K× on llama; that's why template-oriented tasks such as `operator_hotspot` are orders of magnitude faster on PADOC.

### 3.2 Constant detection on numeric columns

Every per-instance numeric column on a `MergeEvent` /
`MergeKernelEvent` is one of:

```
NumColumn = Empty
          | Constant { len, value }
          | I32(Vec<i32>)
          | I64(Vec<i64>)
```

`compact()` on each template detects three cases at finalize time:

1. all values equal → `Constant { len, value }` — `sum_i64()` is one
   integer multiply, `get(i)` is `O(1)`.
2. range fits in `i32` after subtracting the start-of-trace timestamp
   → `I32(Vec<i32>)` — half the bytes, half the cache misses.
3. otherwise → `I64(Vec<i64>)` — never happens in practice on the four
   datasets (see § 3 of `EXPERIMENTS.md`: `i64 cols = 0` everywhere).

For analyses that already iterate templates, the per-template work is
either constant-time (case 1) or a tight `i32` sum (case 2). For
analyses that have to look at per-instance values, the `Constant` case
makes the inner loop disappear — a homogeneous GPU template can
contribute its whole duration sum to one bucket in `O(1)`.

### 3.3 Pre-computed structure for layer / rank queries

Two specific tasks would otherwise be expensive even on a template
representation:

* **Layer/repeated-scope GPU attribution** — the current core layer-aware tasks first identify explicit layer names when present, otherwise use repeated `SameCpu` scopes as model/block instances. They then follow `KernelLaunch` / `KernelsLaunch` CPU-GPU provenance edges to collect the kernels inside that scope. The `no_kernel_links` ablation drops attributed GPU refs to zero, which is the direct evidence that these edges are semantically necessary.
* **Per-rank busy time** — every rank has its own root node in the template tree, with child offsets that group GPU and comm kernels together. `rank_load_balance` walks each rank's subtree and adds `tmpl.dur_total()` (which is `NumColumn::sum_i64`) into the rank's compute or comm bucket, depending on the template's stream category. Baselines have to globally sort kernel events by `(pid, stream, ts)` before they can produce the same per-rank totals, which is what the 19–22 s of analyse time on the baselines pays for.

### 3.4 What does **not** speed up

`stream_load_balance`, `layer_operator_balance`, and global `compute_comm_overlap` are now historical/background tasks, not the core paper suite. The final core suite is `operator_hotspot`, `rank_load_balance`, and the three layer-aware GPU tasks.

`.gitignore` now ignores root-level `*.log`, `*.tsv`, `*.bin`, `*.zst`, so
ad-hoc experiments don't pollute the tracked tree any more.

Cluster: both `sc1` (32 cores, 256 GiB) and `sc4` (64 cores, 256 GiB)
mount the same NFS, so artifacts under `/mnt/treasure/ljx/artifacts/`
are visible from either host. Use sc4 for `llama_full` and sc1 for
the other three.

## 5. Suggested ordering for what's left

Estimated effort + the section it unlocks in the paper.

| Order | Task | Effort | Unlocks |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | T2 / T3 MoE / ViT traces | depends on whether we can find one | extra rows for the compression-ratio table |
| 2 | H2 multi-threaded analyse | open design | only if reviewers complain |
| 3 | A5 additional analysis | open | nice-to-have |

The core experiment backlog is now done. The remaining items are either
contingent on missing traces (T2, T3) or optional reviewer-defence /
nice-to-have work (H2, A5).

## 6. Notes for the next agent

* **Don't ask for confirmation on routine compute tasks** — the PI
  explicitly said `执行命令不需要我的确认`. Just run things on the
  cluster.
* **Do experiments on the cluster, not locally** — the PI said
  `尽量在集群上做实验，不然我的电脑会变卡`. Use `ssh sc1` / `ssh sc4`
  and `numactl --interleave=all`.
* **Compress speed is not the headline** — the PI said
  `我们不是很关注压缩的性能提升，所以关于压缩的性能，只需要汇报下最快的那个耗时就行了`.
  The headline is **compression+analysis co-design**: smaller in-memory
  representation → faster random-access analysis. Storage breakdown,
  ablation, and analyse speed-up are what carry the paper.
* **Always verify lossless** — every baseline (raw / gzip / ScalaTrace
  / TraceZip) was rewritten to be bit-exact. Before adding any new
  compressor, baseline, or compaction toggle, re-run
  `padoc roundtrip <dir>` on `leworldmodel_full` to confirm
  `LOSSLESS = YES`.
* **The `parallel_group` source file still has its old name** —
  `src/analysis/parallel_group.rs` — but the registered task name is
  `rank_load_balance`. Don't be confused; that's intentional so we
  don't have to rewrite git history.
* **Per-rank fallback for ScalaTrace / TraceZip on llama-1024 is the
  honest baseline** — cross-rank construction OOMs there even with
  256 GiB. Mention this in the paper as a finding ("PADOC scales to
  trace sizes where cross-rank ScalaTrace/TraceZip can't run"), don't
  hide it.

Have fun.
